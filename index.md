## ItsFlywheel

I make programs for GD and Minecraft, I'm still shit, so I'm learning still.

Current projects I want to create soon:
fwGD (A geometry dash modding tool to just have some fun and mess with the game.)
FatalWin Hub (An application to access all of the FatalWin's products and maybe VoidDupes products aswell- `VoidDupes is a project similar to FatalWin and are connected with FatalWin.`

### More

To download my polished programs go to the [FatalWin Discord](https://dsc.gg/fatalwin/).
Contact me on this Discord server aswell.
